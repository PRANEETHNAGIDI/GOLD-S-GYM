<h1>1. “Do I Need to Work Out Every Day?”</h1>
<p style="font-size: 1.75rem;">Answer</p>
<p>No, you do not need to work out every day. In fact, in most cases, I would recommend at least 1-2 days of total rest a week. However, just because you have a rest or recovery day scheduled into your calendar, doesn’t necessarily mean you aren’t active at all on these days. Light, regular movement such as walking your dog around the block, or taking time for stretching or foam rolling are great recovery techniques to help increase blood flow and reduce tension in tight muscles. Participating in regular rest days and practicing a well-balanced recovery routine can help you reduce your risk for injury and promote the longevity of your fitness routine.
